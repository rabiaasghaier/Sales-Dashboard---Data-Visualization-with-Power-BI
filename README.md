# Project Overview
This project focuses on building an interactive Sales Dashboard to analyze and visualize BMW car sales data using Power BI. The dashboard provides valuable insights into sales performance, trends, and key performance indicators (KPIs), helping stakeholders make informed decisions and optimize sales strategies.

The dataset includes detailed sales records of BMW vehicles, covering various models, sales regions, time periods, and customer segments. Using Power BIâ€™s powerful visualization and data modeling capabilities, this project transforms raw data into clear, actionable business intelligence.

# Objectives
To collect and clean BMW car sales data for accurate analysis.

To create a data model that connects sales data with product and geography information.

To build a user-friendly, interactive dashboard that highlights key sales metrics.

To uncover trends, top-performing models, and regional insights.

To provide actionable recommendations for sales improvement and strategy optimization.

# Project Steps
1. Data Collection and Preparation
The project started by gathering BMW sales data from multiple sources, including sales reports and customer records. The data was cleaned to handle missing values, remove duplicates, and standardize formats. Additional calculated fields, such as profit margins and sales categories, were added to enrich the analysis.

2. Data Modeling in Power BI
The cleaned data was imported into Power BI Desktop. Relationships between tables (sales, products, regions) were established to enable cross-filtering and detailed analysis. Key performance measures were created using DAX formulas, including total revenue, units sold, average sale price, and sales growth rates.

3. Dashboard Design
An intuitive dashboard was designed with the end-user in mind. It features interactive charts such as bar graphs for sales by model, maps showing regional performance, and line charts for sales trends over time. Filters and slicers allow users to drill down into specific periods, models, or regions.

4. Analysis and Insights
The dashboard revealed important insights:

The best-selling BMW models across different markets.

Seasonal sales peaks and low periods.

Regional disparities highlighting growth opportunities.

Customer segments with the highest purchasing frequency.

5. Publishing and Sharing
The final dashboard was published on Power BI Service to enable easy sharing and collaboration. User roles and permissions were configured for secure access. Scheduled data refresh was set up to keep the dashboard up-to-date with the latest sales data.

# Tools and Technologies
Power BI Desktop & Service for data modeling, visualization, and sharing.

DAX for creating calculated measures and KPIs.

Excel / CSV files as data sources.

# Conclusion
This Sales Dashboard project demonstrates how Power BI can be leveraged to transform raw sales data into meaningful insights. For BMW, the dashboard acts as a powerful decision-support tool, helping sales managers track performance, identify trends, and make data-driven strategic choices. The project showcases the impact of effective data visualization in automotive sales analytics.
